## Decision
In this phase of the calculator project, the team focused on making key decisions to ensure a structured and efficient workflow. The following decisions were made:

**Core and Optional Features**
The team analyzed all the features listed in the project brief and selected the core features that are mandatory, such as basic arithmetic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square roots, and factorials. Additionally, we reviewed the optional feature blocks and collectively decided to implement the Geometry block. This includes calculations for areas of shapes like circles, squares, rectangles, triangles, and trapezoids, as well as volumes of spheres, cubes, cuboids, cylinders, and cones.

**Task Assignment**
We divided the project tasks among the team members to ensure equal contribution. Each member was assigned a specific set of functions to implement, ensuring that the workload is evenly distributed. For instance, one member was tasked with the implementation of arithmetic operations, while another focused on geometric calculations.
