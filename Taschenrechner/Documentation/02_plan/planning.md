# Planning
After understanding the project requirements and aligning on some initial ideas, we were ready to move on to planning. We knew that careful planning was essential to avoid any misunderstandings that could waste time. To keep our planning organized and clear, we created a detailed task list, milestone list and a general timetable to guide us through each step of the project. We used an Excel spreadsheet that everyone could edit, ensuring that all team members were on the same page. Our initial plan was to divide the main functions between two team members, while one person would handle the geometric feature. If time allowed, we would all work together on the remaining features. 

## Initial Steps and what is important to us
Before starting with the coding and organizing tasks across different files, we needed to clearly define each task. It was very important to us that the workload was balanced so that no one had too much or too little to do. Since we were a team of three, we decided that all of us would participate in the coding process: Thomas and Abigail would work on the main functions, Jara would handle the geometric feature, and Abigail would take care of the documentation. 

## Resource plan
The resource plan was developed to map out team members' availability and allocate sufficient time for each task. It provided a clear overview of working hours, helping to manage time effectively and ensuring the project stayed on track. Though the plan wasn't followed exactly every day, efforts were made to adjust work schedules as closely as possible to the original outline. The plan also highlighted potential scheduling conflicts or gaps, allowing for early adjustments. For instance, Quint's delayed participation due to illness was factored in, ensuring tasks were distributed effectively and any challenges were addressed promptly. With a total estimated effort of 83 hours, time was allocated strategically across coding, testing, documentation, and final presentation preparations. This approach ensured smooth progress and helped prevent last minute stress as the project neared its deadline.

## Task list
The task list was created to outline all the essential activities needed for the project. Each task was assigned a specific start and end date, helping us stay on track and maintain a clear workflow. Importantly, everyone on the team had access to the task list, allowing for transparency and collaboration. Tasks were divided into categories such as coding, testing, documentation, and presentations. This breakdown allowed us to focus on our specific responsibilities while understanding how our work fit into the overall project.

## Milestone list
To clarify our expectations, we established early milestones as benchmarks for our project. By reflecting on our progress towards these milestones, we can gain valuable insights into our project management skills. We kept these milestones high-level to maintain a clear focus and avoid unnecessary complexity. It may be beneficial to get deeper into specific milestones to gain a more comprehensive understanding of our achievements.

## Communication and Collaboration
We understood the importance of good communication and teamwork, so we decided to use Microsoft Teams and GitHub as our main platforms for discussions and code sharing. We set up a routine to check in with each other at least three times a day, at the start of the day, before lunch, and in the evening. This regular communication kept us aligned and helped us address any issues quickly. If any problems came up, we agreed to meet and discuss them as a team, providing support to each other and ensuring that no one was left struggling alone. This collaborative approach was key to our success, helping us work well together and stay productive.
