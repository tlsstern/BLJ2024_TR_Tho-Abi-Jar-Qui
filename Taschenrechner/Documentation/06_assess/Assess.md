# Assessment

Evaluating a project after it's finished is important. It helps us learn from what we did well and what we can do better. Remember that everyone in the team may have different ideas. The following sections aim to highlight key points.

## What went well?

The team communicated well throughout the project. This dedication created a good teamwork where ideas matched the teams goals, and everyone was open to suggestions. Even with a planned workflow, the team understood the need for flexibility. Their adaptable nature allowed for effective task sharing, making sure that most parts of the project were completed on time.

## Areas for improvement in future projects

Overall, our project went well because we implemented all the main functions that were required, as well as additional features. However, we were not able to implement all the features, as one of the algebra blocks was time consuming to complete. For improvement, we might have informed us earlier about Quint’s level of knowledge or experience so that we could have assigned the feature tasks more effectively. It took Quint some time to familiarize himself with the topic, but on the other hand, we were all pleased because it reflected our programming effort. We were open to questions and willing to help each other along the way.

## Strategies for improvement next time

Our point of improvement could be in passing on information. Maybe better coordinate which task needs more time and clarify this in connection with the missing persons.

Our team worked well together. We communicated effectively and efficiently, and everyone was committed to the calculator project. Our careful planning was instrumental in the project's success. I believe we achieved our objectives because we had a clear understanding of our desired outcomes. In this project, I initially wrote the code within the main function instead of utilizing functions, which was a less effective approach. I realized this and had to invest up to 15min in restructuring my code. I believe this could have been prevented from me with first thinking before doing so. Neverless i enjoyed coding, refreshing and implementing what we heard in the inputs. I valued the willingness of my teammates to address my questions. It created a supportive and cooperative atmosphere. I think that I made a contribution to the project, including the development of the documentation. I am eager to receive feedback from my team members on the documentation so I can learn from their insights and refine my skills.

I was able to effectively manage my time, leaving room for additional features at the end of the project. The team communication and implementation of code features went well. My main challenges were with GitHub, as the program frequently failed to locate my CMake file, requiring me to reinitialize the repository multiple times. I also encountered issues with format specifiers and the switch statement due to mistakenly redeclaring functions instead of calling them. I believe I made a significant contribution to the functionality of the basic and advanced features, as well as to the overall planning within the group. Initially, communication was a bit challenging due to one of our team members being ill, which hindered task coordination. However, we were able to overcome this obstacle effectively. For future group projects, I hope that the team's performance and dedication remain high and that the project requirements, such as programming language, branching strategy, etc., are clearly defined from the outset. I enjoyed working independently on coding tasks as it allowed me to focus. However, research on more complex functions was more time-consuming than expected.

**Quint**

I, Quint Gerard André Bloemen, was unable to work with the team in the first week because I was unfortunately ill. At the time of writing, I am back with the group. I haven't done much for the assignment yet, but I'm trying to make up for lost time. I am very proud of the rest of the group how they managed without me during the first week. When I came back I could only work on the bug fixes, which was very successful.
