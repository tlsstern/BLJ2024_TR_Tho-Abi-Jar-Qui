# Inform
We were assigned a project to develop a calculator in C, and our group consists of four members who were randomly selected. As soon as we received the assignment, we introduced ourselves to each other. One person was sick, so we reached out to check on their health, wished them a speedy recovery, and asked if they were feeling better. This information was important as it would later influence our planning. We made sure everyone was included in the information sharing process, and first, everyone read the document that outlined the specific requirements. We also asked our instructor how much time we had to complete the project. They informed us that we had the entire time until the deadline, without providing any additional inputs.

## Information Required
**Submission Deadline** 
* Thursday, September 26, 2024, at 11:00 AM. Submissions after this deadline will not be accepted.

**Schedules**
The planned working hours are:

* Friday, September 20, 2024: Full day (For Ergon and Google: 8 hours, the rest 8.40 hours)
* Wednesday, September 25, 2024: Full day
* Thursday, September 26,2024: 3 hours
* We have allocated 82 hours to complete the project. Assuming Quint will appear on Wednesday, September 25th, and Thursday, September 26th.

**Deliverables**
The final product will include:
* A fully functional calculator
* Documentation according to the IPERKA methodology, including a testing protocol
* A presentation of the code with minimum five minutes, maximum seven minutes
* Submission on GitHub

**Knowledge Requirements**
* Fundamental knowledge of C programming and mathematical operations
* The knowledge we gained from the inputs and GitHub

**Assignment Guidelines & Instructions**
* The project must follow the IPERKA methodology (Inform, Plan, Decide, Realize, Control, Assess).
* The repository must be named BLJ2024_TR_First-First-First-First and the instructors must be added as collaborators.
* Mandatory Features must be implemented and one optional feature block must be selected. Faster groups can implement all features.
* The math.h header file cannot be used for feature implementation.
* The code must be according to the "Definition of Done" standards.
* Each group member should contribute approximately the same amount of work. This should be reflected in the commits.

**Roles & Responsibilities**
* Thomas: Responsible for implementing addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and Scissors-stone-paper game functionalities.
* Abigail: Responsible for implementing exponents, roots, factorial functionalities, Life Science (3 from 4 parts) and documentation.
* Jara: Responsible for implementing the whole geometry features, the main function and Life Science.
* Quint: Responsible for programming the optional algebra module. 

## Gathering information
### Requirements for the Product
* We combined the requirements from two sources: our instructors' specifications and our own ideas. To get a better overview, we have collected all the requirements in an Excel spreadsheet

## Tools & Software needed
* Visual Studio Code
  * A code editor for writing and debugging C code. It offers features like syntax highlighting, code completion and debugging tools.
 
* GitHub
  * A web-based version control and collaboration platform. It allows to track our changes to our code, collaborate with each other, and manage our project's history. We will need it for the submission of the project.

* Excel
  * We will create our lists on excel, it can be collaborate with each other. 

* Microsoft's Snipping tool
  * It allows us to capture specific areas of our screen for documentation or presentation purposes.

* CLion
  * It provides advanced features for writing, debugging, and analyzing C code.

* Microsoft Teams
  * In microsoft we will communicate, write and therefore inform each other.
