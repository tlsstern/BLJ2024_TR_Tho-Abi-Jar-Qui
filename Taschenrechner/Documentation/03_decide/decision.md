## Decision
In this phase of the calculator project, the team focused on making key decisions to ensure a structured and efficient workflow. The following decisions were made:

### Decision matrix
**Core and Optional Features**

The team analyzed all the features listed in the project brief and selected the core features, which are essential for the calculator's basic functionality. These core features include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square roots, and factorials. To prioritize the optional features, we did a decision matrix. This tool helped us identify geometry and algebra as the most promising candidates. We then determined that one team member would focus on implementing either geometry or algebra, depending on their individual expertise and preference. The remaining team members would concentrate on developing the core functionalities.

**Task Assignment**

We divided the project tasks among the team members to ensure equal contribution. Each member was assigned a specific set of functions to implement, ensuring that the workload is evenly distributed. For instance, one member was tasked with the implementation of arithmetic operations, while another focused on geometric calculations. We also decided on the division of the presentation and who will present each part. We agreed that the person who coded it will present it. Since Quint was sick, he will do the introduction and conclusion, but he will also present the algebra block with Jara.
